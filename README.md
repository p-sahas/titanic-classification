# Mini Project 01 - Titanic Classification

This project is a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, involving data preprocessing, model implementation from scratch, and comparison with library-based models. The from-scratch implementations include advanced models such as a Decision Tree, Simple Bagging, AdaBoost, and Logistic Regression with AdaGrad optimization.

## File Structure

- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: The dataset file.
- `Mini-Project-01-Titanic-Classification.pdf`: The project description.
- `A_minimal_prep_and_split.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data preparation.
- `B_from_scratch_models.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for from-scratch model implementations.
- `C_library_models.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for library-based model implementations.
- `D_report.md`: The project report in Markdown format.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Execution Instructions

1.  Ensure you have a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook installed.
2.  Install the required dependencies listed below.
3.  Run the notebooks in the following order:
    1.  `A_minimal_prep_and_split.ipynb`
    2.  `B_from_scratch_models.ipynb`
    3.  `C_library_models.ipynb`
4.  The results and model performance can be found in the notebooks and are summarized in `D_report.md`.
